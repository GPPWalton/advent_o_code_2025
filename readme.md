# Advent of Code 2025 - My Solutions

This repo contains the solutions to 2025's Advent of Code Challenges as solved by myself (provided I _actually_ solve them all...).

At the time of writing I am learning rust and trying to keep my skills sharp, so the enclosed repo is probably needlessly complex, but I was never known for making things easy on myself! -.-

I've included some instructions on how to use the repo below, this will no doubt change as the challenge progresses but for now the commands are as follows.

## Commands

**To run the project** - `cargo run [day_n] [part_2]` _where n is the day of the challenge and m/method is used to show the second part of the solution._

for example day 1 would be:
`cargo run day_1` for part 1

**And**
`cargo run day_1 part_2` for part 2.
